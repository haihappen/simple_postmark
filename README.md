# simple_postmark18

SimplePostmark makes it easy to send mails via [Postmark](http://postmarkapp.com)â„¢ using Rails 3's ActionMailer.
SimplePostmark is inspired by [postmark-gem](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-gem), but unfortunately postmark-gem forced to me to use non-standard Rails calls like `postmark_attachments`. SimplePostmark uses the standard Rails 3's ActionMailer syntax to send your emails via Postmark.

This is the backported version of [simple_postmark](https://github.com/haihappen/simple_postmark) called `simple_postmark18`. It's tested against Ruby `1.8.7` and `Ruby Enterprise Edition` and Rails versions `3.0.x`, `3.1.x` and `3.2.x`.

**WARNING**: Rails master (a.k.a Rails `4.0.0`) will discontinue supporting Ruby versions lower than `1.9.3`, so be sure to update your Ruby installation as soon as possible to Ruby `1.9.3`! `simple_postmark18` will not work with any Rails `4.0.0` app, so be sure to switch from `simple_postmark18` to simply `simple_postmark` (which will continue to support Rails `4.0.0`).

## Installation

In your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :production do
  gem 'simple_postmark18'
end
```

In your `config/environments/production.rb`:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :simple_postmark
config.action_mailer.simple_postmark_settings = { :api_key => '********-****-****-****-************' }
```

## Usage

Just use your standard Rails 3 Mailer:

```ruby
class NotificationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def notification
    mail(:to => 'ted@himym.tld', :from => 'barney@himym.tld', :subject => "I'm your bro!") do
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

And of course you can use standard attachment calls and [Postmark's tags](http://developer.postmarkapp.com/developer-build.html#message-format):

```ruby
class NotificationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def notification
    attachments['thebrocode.pdf'] = File.read('thebrocode.pdf')
  
    mail(:to => 'ted@himym.tld', :from => 'barney@himym.tld', :subject => "I'm your bro!", :tag => 'with-attachment') do
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```
