# simple_postmark [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haihappen/simple_postmark.png)](https://travis-ci.org/haihappen/simple_postmark)

simple_postmark makes it easy to send mails via [Postmark](http://postmarkapp.com)™ using Rails's ActionMailer.

~~simple_postmark is inspired by [postmark-gem](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-gem), but unfortunately postmark-gem forced to me to use non-standard Rails calls like `postmark_attachments`. simple_postmark uses the standard Rails's ActionMailer syntax to send your emails via Postmark.~~

**Update**  
It seems that the [issue](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-rails/issues/17#issuecomment-13761405) was fixed in the `0.9.19` version of the [postmark gem](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-gem), which marks this gem as obligatory. However I have not decided what to do, so simple_postmark will still be there for a while. At least until Rails `4.0` is released.

Tested against Ruby versions `1.9.2`, `1.9.3` and Rails versions `3.0.x`, `3.1.x`, `3.2.x`.
`ruby-head`, `2.0` and Rails `master` should work too btw.

If you are still using Ruby `1.8.7` or `Ruby Enterprise Edition` with Rails, you can use the backported version of this gem called [simple_postmark18](https://github.com/haihappen/simple_postmark/tree/ruby18).

## Installation

In your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :production do
  gem 'simple_postmark'
end
```

In your `config/environments/production.rb`:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :simple_postmark
config.action_mailer.simple_postmark_settings = { api_key: '********-****-****-****-************' }
```

## Usage

Just use your standard Rails Mailer:

```ruby
class NotificationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def notification
    mail(to: 'ted@himym.tld', from: 'barney@himym.tld', subject: "I'm your bro!") do
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

And of course you can use standard attachment calls and [Postmark's tags](http://developer.postmarkapp.com/developer-build.html#message-format):

```ruby
class NotificationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def notification
    attachments['thebrocode.pdf'] = File.read('thebrocode.pdf')

    mail(to: 'ted@himym.tld', from: 'barney@himym.tld', subject: "I'm your bro!", tag: 'with-attachment') do
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

## Advanced Configuration

* `api_key`: Your Postmark API key. Go to [your Rack](https://postmarkapp.com/servers),
selected the one you want to use and then go to the **Credentials** tab to find your API key.

* `return_response`: In order to receive the response from the Postmark API
– for example, if you want to store ErrorCode or MessageID -
set it to `true`. ([Mail](https://github.com/mikel/mail) which is the base of simple_postmark
expects this option.)

Example how the ErrorCode, MessageID and other values can be received from Postmark:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
config.action_mailer.simple_postmark_settings = { api_key: '********-****-****-****-************', return_response: true }

# your_mailer.rb
response = YourMailer.email.deliver!.parsed_response

response['MessageID']
  # => "b7bc2f4a-e38e-4336-af7d-e6c392c2f817"
response['ErrorCode']
  # => 0
```

## Testing

Testing simple_postmark is, well, simple. ;)

```ruby
# config/environments/test.rb
config.action_mailer.simple_postmark_settings = { api_key: 'POSTMARK_API_TEST', return_response: true }
```

With this setup, it will actually trigger a connection to the Postmark API, but Postmark will never send any emails and nothing will be delivered to your recipients.
